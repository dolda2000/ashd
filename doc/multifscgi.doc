NAME
----
multifscgi - Manage multiple instances of a FastCGI or SCGI server

SYNOPSIS
--------
*multifscgi* [*-h*] 'NUM' 'PROGRAM' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*multifscgi* is a simple program intended to manage multiple running
instances of a FastCGI or SCGI server. It is distributed as part of
*ashd*(7).

The utility of multifscgi lies in the fact some FastCGI or SCGI server
programs, such as PHP, process at most one request at a time. As such,
multiple such server processes must run simultaneously in order to
process requests concurrently.

The *multifscgi* program works simply by forking 'NUM' instances of
whatever program it is given on its command line. As long as the SCGI
or FastCGI listen socket is passed on standard input, it will be
naturally inherited by those child processes, and whichever one of
them is currently idle will be able to accept a request. If any of the
children terminate, a new one will be started in its place.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

SIGNALS
-------

SIGTERM, SIGINT::

	Terminate cleanly be killing off any remaining child
	processes.
