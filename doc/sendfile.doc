NAME
----
sendfile - Static file handler for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sendfile* [*-c* 'CONTENT-TYPE'] [*-f* 'FILE'] 'METHOD' 'URL' 'REST'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sendfile* serves static files by sending them exactly as they are to
clients. It needs to be called with the `X-Ash-File` header added to
the request, as *dirplex*(1) does, unless the *-f* option is given.

*sendfile* is a transient handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
'METHOD', 'URL' and 'REST' arguments will normally be added by the
parent handler.

Normally, *sendfile* will serve the file named by the `X-Ash-File`
header, and fail with a 404 error in case the rest string is not
empty. However, if the *-f* argument is given, the given 'FILE' will
always be served instead, and the `X-Ash-File` header and any rest
string is ignored.

A file's MIME type may be specified explicitly either by using the
*-c* option, or by passing the header `X-Ash-Content-Type` to
*sendfile* with the MIME type of the file. That header might, for
instance, be set using the *set* directives of *dirplex*(1) or
*patplex*(1).

If a MIME-type is not explicitly specified, *sendfile* uses
*libmagic*(3) to determine the MIME-type automatically. If *sendfile*
is compiled with support for filesystem attributes (see *attr*(5) if
your system has support for such attributes), the attributes
`user.ash-mime-type`, `user.mime-type`, `user.mime_type` or
`user.Content-Type` will be checked, in that order, and if one is
present on the file in question, its value will be used instead of
using *libmagic*.

*sendfile* supports the following HTTP features:

 * Caching, using the `Last-Modified` and related headers.

 * Partial content, using the `Range` and related headers.

OPTIONS
-------

*-c* 'CONTENT-TYPE'::

	Send 'CONTENT-TYPE' as the file's MIME-type instead of trying
	to auto-detect the file type.

*-f* 'FILE'::

	Ignore the `X-Ash-File` header and force 'FILE' to be served
	instead. Any remaining rest string is also ignored.
