NAME
----
htextauth - HTTP Basic authenticator for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*htextauth* [*-hCs*] [*-r* 'REALM'] 'AUTHCMD' ['ARGS'...] `--` 'CHILD' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *htextauth* handler starts a single child handler which it passes
all requests it receives, assuming they pass an authentication
test. *htextauth* will request HTTP Basic credentials from the client,
and pass such credentials to an external program in order to verify
them. The authentication program will be called every time a new user
needs to be authenticated. See the AUTHENTICATION section, below, for
the calling convention used for the authentication program.

*htextauth* is a persistent handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
specified child handler must also be a persistent handler.

By default, *htextauth* will cache successfully verified credentials,
so that the authentication program does not have to be called for each
and every request. Cached credentials are cleared from the cache when
they have not been used for over 30 minutes.

If the child handler exits, *htextauth* exits as well.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-C*::

	Do not cache credentials.

*-s*::

	Require that all requests are made over HTTPS.

*-r* 'REALM'::

	Specify 'REALM' as the authentication realm when requesting
	credentials from the client.

AUTHENTICATION
--------------

When a previously unseen user needs to be authenticated, *htextauth*
will fork and execute the 'AUTHCMD' program, with any arguments that
follow. *htextauth* will pass two lines of text to the authentication
program's standard input: the given user name on the first line, and
the password on the second. The credentials are checked in advance so
that they do not contain any control characters (below ASCII 32).

If the authentication program successfully verifies the credentials
and wishes to grant access to the client, it needs to exit
successfully; that is, with exit status 0. Any other exit (including
being killed by a signal) is taken by *htextauth* as a failure.

The authentication program can specify a reason for any failure by
writing such on standard output. If the program exits unsuccessfully,
*htextauth* will include any such message in the error page sent to
the client.

Note that *htextauth* will wait for the authentication program to exit
and not process any other requests until then.
