NAME
----
callcgi - CGI request handler for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*callcgi* [*-c*] [*-p* 'PROGRAM'] 'METHOD' 'URL' 'REST'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*callcgi* serves CGI scripts by translating the *ashd*(7) request
environment into a standard CGI environment and executing the target
file. It needs to be called with the `X-Ash-File` header added to the
request, as *dirplex*(1) does.

*callcgi* is a transient handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
'METHOD', 'URL' and 'REST' arguments will normally be added by the
parent handler.

The CGI script is called with its own filename as the first and only
command-line parameter.

OPTIONS
-------

*-c*::

	Change directory to the directory containing the CGI script
	before running it. This behavior is encouraged by the CGI
	specification, but is not used by *callcgi* by default.

*-p* 'PROGRAM'::

	Call 'PROGRAM' instead of the file itself. This mechanism can
	be used to serve e.g. PHP scripts and other programs that have
	an interpreter that can act as a CGI script. The filename of
	the actual script is still passed as the first and only
	command-line parameter to the program.
