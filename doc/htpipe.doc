NAME
----
htpipe - Ashd decoupler pipe

SYNOPSIS
--------
*htpipe* [*-h*] [*-CS*] 'SOCKET-PATH' ['CHILD' ['ARGS'...]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *htpipe* handler implements piping of *ashd*(7) requests over a
named Unix socket. The main reason for doing so would be to isolate an
*ashd*(7) handler program from the effects of restarting its parent
process. In particular, it is useful for isolating the entire handler
process tree from restarting *htparser*(1), which may be done
particularly often for such reasons as certificate renewal.

If the *-S* flag is given to start *htpipe* in server mode, *htpipe*
will start listening to a socket named by 'SOCKET-PATH', start a
handler program as specified by 'CHILD' and 'ARGS', accept connections
on said socket, and pass requests received on such connections to the
handler program. It can handle an arbitrary amount of such
connections, but it is not implemented for high performance with a
large number of connections. It is expected that the ordinary will
involve very few connections, usually only one at a time.

If the *-C* flag is given the start *htpipe* in client mode, *htpipe*
will connect to the socket named by 'SOCKET-PATH', accept requests
from standard input, and pass such requests over said socket,
presumably to an *htpipe* instance running in server mode on the other
end.

By default, when neither the *-S* nor the *-C* option is given,
*htpipe* will attempt to connect to the socket named by 'SOCKET-PATH'
and, if that succeeds, go on running in client mode, just as if the
*-C* option had been given. If, however, the connection fails, it will
fork a copy of itself to run in server mode, and then reconnect to the
socket presumably created by that new process.

*htpipe* is a persistent handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
specified child handler must also be a persistent handler.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-C*::

	Run in dedicated client mode, as described above. In this
	mode, the 'CHILD' argument does not need to be given.

*-S*::

	Run in dedicated server mode, as described above. In this
	mode, as well as when neither the *-C* nor the *-S* option
	were given, the 'CHILD' argument is mandatory.
