===========

NAME
----
callfcgi - FastCGI request handler for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*callfcgi* [*-h*] [*-N* 'RETRIES'] [*-i* 'ID'] [*-u* 'UNIXPATH'] [*-t* \[HOST:]'TCPPORT'] ['PROGRAM' ['ARGS'...]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *callfcgi* handler uses FastCGI to call an external handler for
requests. *callfcgi* is a persistent handler, as defined in *ashd*(7).

*callfcgi* works identically to the *callscgi*(1) program in all
respects except using the FastCGI protocol rather then the SCGI
protocol, so see the manpage for *callscgi* for all the details.

In relation to the FastCGI protocol, it should be noted that
*callfcgi* does not multiplex several requests over one opened FastCGI
connection, but rather opens one connection for each request.
