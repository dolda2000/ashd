NAME
----
httrcall - Call transient ashd handlers

SYNOPSIS
--------
*httrcall* [*-h*] [*-l* 'LIMIT'] 'PROGRAM' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*httrcall* is a persistent handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), but works
by starting a specified transient handler for every incoming
request. Thus, it can be used to run transient handlers where normally
only persistent handlers are accepted, such as for the program
specified to *accesslog*(1), *htextauth*(1) or even *htparser*(1).

The transient handler to call is specified by the 'PROGRAM'
argument. Any 'ARGS' given are prepended to the usual arguments for
transient handlers, as described in *ashd*(7).

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-l* 'LIMIT'::

	If specified, only 'LIMIT' copies of the handler program are
	allowed to run at one time. If further request are received
	while 'LIMIT' children are running, *httrcall* will block,
	waiting for one to exit before processing further requests. If
	no *-l* option is specified, *httrcall* imposes no limit on
	the number of children that may run.
