errlogger(1)
============

NAME
----
errlogger - Redirect standard error of a program to the system log

SYNOPSIS
--------
*errlogger* [*-h*] [*-n* 'NAME'] [*-f* 'FACILITY'] [*-p* 'PRIORITY'] 'PROGRAM' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*errlogger* starts the given 'PROGRAM' with its standard error
connected to a (write-only) pipe, the other end of which *errlogger*
will read lines from. Every line so read will be logged to the system
log.

The utility of *errlogger* is in the ability to log error messages
from programs connected to no other saved output, such as programs
started by *ashd*(7) in daemon mode.

*errlogger* will exit as soon as it reads end-of-file on its end of
the pipe; that is, when the write-end of the pipe is closed, which
will usually happen when the program exits.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-n* 'NAME'::

	Use 'NAME' as the log identification. If not given, 'PROGRAM'
	will be used by default.

*-f* 'FACILITY'::

	Log to the given log facility, which may be any of *auth*,
	*authpriv*, *cron*, *daemon*, *ftp*, *kern*, *lpr*, *mail*,
	*news*, *user*, *uucp* or *local0* through *local7*. By
	default, *daemon* is used.

*-p* 'PRIORITY'::

	Log at the given log priority, which may be any of *emerg*,
	*alert*, *crit*, *err*, *warning*, *notice*, *info* or
	*debug*. By default, *warning* is used.
