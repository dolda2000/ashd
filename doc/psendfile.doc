psendfile(1)
============

NAME
----
psendfile - Persistent static file handler for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*psendfile* [*-h*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*psendfile* is a variant of *sendfile*(1) that runs as a persistent
handler. Except those actions of *sendfile* explicitly triggered by
command-line options, *psendfile* does the exact same things as
*sendfile*, the only difference being that it runs persistently and
handles all requests in the same process, instead of spawning a
process per request. In doing so, it uses more persistent resources in
order to use less resources per request. As such, *psendfile* is more
suitable for a system under heavier load, while *sendfile* is more
suitable for a system under light load.

Accordingly, *psendfile* is a persistent handler, as defined in
*ashd*(7). See the *sendfile*(1) manpage for all the details of its
operations, as it mirrors that program exactly except in the special
options it accepts.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.
