NAME
----
httimed - Ashd handler expiration pipe

SYNOPSIS
--------
*httimed* [*-h*] [*-t* 'TIMEOUT'] 'CHILD' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *httimed* handler starts a single child handler which it passes
all request it receives unmodified, and in addition keeps track of
time and simply exits if no requests are received in a certain
interval, which might be useful for handlers which are only rarely
used and waste unproportionally much system resources if kept beyond
their usefulness.

*httimed* is a persistent handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
specified child handler must also be a persistent handler.

By default, *httimed* exits if it receives no requests in five
minutes, but the time interval can be specified using the *-t* option.

If the child handler exits, *httimed* exits as well.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-t* 'TIMEOUT'::

	Exit if no requests are received after 'TIMEOUT' seconds since
	the last one. If *-t* is not specified, 'TIMEOUT' is five
	minutes by default.
