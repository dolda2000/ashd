NAME
----
htls - Directory lister for ashd(7)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*htls* [*-hms*] [*-c* 'STYLESHEET'] 'METHOD' 'URL' 'REST'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*htls* can be called from *dirplex*(1) for generating listings for
directories that lack an index file. The generated index will be a
HTML table with links to subdirectories and additional file
information as specified by command-line options. It needs to be
called with the `X-Ash-File` header added to the request, as
*dirplex*(1) does.

*htls* is a transient handler, as defined in *ashd*(7), and the
'METHOD', 'URL' and 'REST' arguments will normally be added by the
parent handler.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-m*::

	Include the time of last modification for the listed files and
	directories in the listing.

*-s*::

	Include the size of the listed files in the listing.

*-c* 'STYLESHEET'::

	Instead of including an inline stylesheet, insert 'STYLESHEET'
	as a stylesheet link in the generated index.
