This example uses Python to dynamically dispatch requests for
different vhosts. The Python program dynhosts will look in a directory
for subdirectories named after the virtual host and start a dirplex
instance for each such host that is requested.

To try this example, run it on your local machine and request
<http://localhost:8080/> or <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>.
