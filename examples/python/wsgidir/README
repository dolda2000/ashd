This example demonstrates how the shipped Python module ashd.wsgidir
can be used to call WSGI scripts in dirplex-served directories as
easily as PHP scripts or mod_python scripts under Apache.

To try this example, run it on your local machine and request
<http://localhost:8080/> or <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>.
