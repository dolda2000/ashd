This directory contains some examples of more or less simple ashd
configurations. Each sub-directory contains a self-contained example
with a shell script called `run'. Simply run that script to start the
example, and examine it to see how it was made. All of them will start
an non-SSL HTTP server on port 8080.

Note that ashd, including the default configuration files, must be
installed on the system to be able to run the examples.

The `python' sub-directory contains examples for using the Python
module. To run them, the Python module has to be installed and
accessible as well.
