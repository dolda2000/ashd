"""WSGI handler for serving chained WSGI modules from physical files

The WSGI handler in this module examines the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable
of the requests it handles -- that is, the physical file corresponding
to the request, as determined by the webserver -- determining what to
do with the request based on the extension of that file.

By default, it handles files named `.wsgi' by compiling them into
Python modules and using them, in turn, as chained WSGI handlers, but
handlers for other extensions can be installed as well.

When handling `.wsgi' files, the compiled modules are cached and
reused until the file is modified, in which case the previous module
is discarded and the new file contents are loaded into a new module in
its place. When chaining such modules, an object named `wmain' is
first looked for and called with no arguments if found. The object it
returns is then used as the WSGI application object for that module,
which is reused until the module is reloaded. If `wmain' is not found,
an object named `application' is looked for instead. If found, it is
used directly as the WSGI application object.

This module itself contains both an `application' and a `wmain'
object. If this module is used by ashd-wsgi(1) or scgi-wsgi(1) so that
its wmain function is called, arguments can be specified to it to
install handlers for other file extensions. Such arguments take the
form `.EXT=MODULE.HANDLER', where EXT is the file extension to be
handled, and the MODULE.HANDLER string is treated by splitting it
along its last constituent dot. The part left of the dot is the name
of a module which is imported, and the part right of the dot is the
name of an object in that module, which should be a callable adhering
to the WSGI specification. When called, this module will have made
sure that the WSGI environment contains the SCRIPT_FILENAME parameter
and that it is properly working. For example, the argument
`.fpy=my.module.foohandler' can be given to pass requests for `.fpy'
files to the function `foohandler' in the module `my.module' (which
must, of course, be importable). When writing such handler functions,
you will probably want to use the getmod() function in this module.
