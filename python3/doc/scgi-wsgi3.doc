scgi-wsgi3(1)
============

NAME
----
scgi-wsgi3 - WSGI adapter for SCGI

SYNOPSIS
--------
*scgi-wsgi3* [*-hA*] [*-m* 'PDM-SPEC'] [*-p* 'MODPATH'] [*-T* \[HOST:]'PORT'] 'HANDLER-MODULE' ['ARGS'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *scgi-wsgi3* program translates SCGI requests to WSGI requests,
and passes them to a specified Python module. It is mainly written to
emulate the behavior of *ashd-wsgi*(1), but over SCGI instead of the
native *ashd*(7) protocol, so please see its documentation for details
of Python interoperation. Unlike *ashd-wsgi* which requires CPython,
however, *scgi-wsgi3* is written in pure Python using only the
standard library, and so should be usable by any Python
implementation. If using it under *ashd*(7), please see the
documentation for *callscgi*(1) as well.

Following *callscgi*(1) conventions, *scgi-wsgi3* will, by default,
accept connections on a socket passed on its standard input (a
behavior which is, obviously, not available on all Python
implementations). Use the *-T* option to listen to a TCP address
instead.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::

	Print a brief help message to standard output and exit.

*-A*::

	Use the convention used by Apache's mod_wsgi module to find
	the WSGI application object. See the PROTOCOL section of
	*ashd-wsgi*(1) for details.

*-p* 'MODPATH'::

	Prepend 'MODPATH' to Python's `sys.path`; can be given multiple
	times.

*-T* \[HOST:]'PORT'::

	Instead of using a listening socket passed on standard input
	to accept SCGI connections, bind a TCP socket to the 'HOST'
	address listening for connections on 'PORT' instead. If 'HOST'
	is not given, `localhost` is used by default.

*-m* 'PDM-SPEC'::

	If the PDM library is installed on the system, create a
	listening socket for connection PDM clients according to
	'PDM-SPEC'.
