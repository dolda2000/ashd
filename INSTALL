			 Ashd -- Installation

This file describes the  most direct way to set up Ashd  so that it is
usable. Since Ashd is quite modular, it is not the only way, but it is
probably the most useful before one  gets a more complete grasp of its
workings.

		       Compiling and Installing

Ashd  itself   uses  the   ordinary  GNU  autotools   compilation  and
installation procedure.   In order to  get it compiled  and installed,
simply run  `./configure', `make' and  `make install' (where  you will
probably want  to run `make install'  as root).  If  you are compiling
from the Git repository, you  will need to run `./bootstrap' first, in
order to create the `configure' script.

Ashd has  few dependencies.   Apart from a  functional C  compiler and
standard system headers, it needs  libmagic. GnuTLS and libattr may be
used  optionally.   If compiling  from  the  Git  repository, the  GNU
autotools  and Asciidoc  need also  be installed.   On  a Debian-based
system,  those  dependencies correspond,  in  order,  to the  packages
build-essential, libmagic-dev,  libgnutls-dev, libattr1-dev, autoconf,
automake and asciidoc.

			    Configuration

When  Ashd is compiled  and installed,  you will  most likely  want to
install  its  default  configuration.   To  do  so,  simply  copy  the
`etc/ashd' directory  into either `/etc' or  `/usr/local/etc'. As long
as  your system  is  fairly normal,  it  should not  matter which  you
choose.

			       Testing

Once  Ashd  itself  and  the  default configuration  files  have  been
installed,  you  can  easily  test  the installation  by  running  the
`examples/static-files/run`  script and pointing  your web  browser at
<http://localhost:8080/>. It and  the other examples generally provide
a good starting point and  some tips for the various configurations in
which Ashd might run. Do check them out, and read `examples/README'.

			   Further Reading

For documentation on how  the examples work, the manpages htparser(1),
dirplex(1)  and  patplex(1)  are  particularly useful  to  read.   The
ashd(7) manpage provides  a description on how Ashd  works on a higher
level, and is useful for a more thorough understanding.
